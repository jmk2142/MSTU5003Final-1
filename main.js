//Rule1: testDate should be no later than college application date(appDate).
//Rule2: if testNum>=2, time between any two testDate should be >=3 month.
//Rule3: prepDate1 should be no less than 1 month before testDate1. Same for other prepDate/testDate pair(s) if there is any.
//Rule4: if user's grade is <12th grade, testNum should be >=2.
//Question: how to grab these dates, compute them, and output them.
